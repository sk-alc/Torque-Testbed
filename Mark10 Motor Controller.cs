// Example C#.net code for writing and reading a serial port
 // Can wrap the writes and reads into separate, generalized functions,
 // for example, "WriteCommand(string command)‚Äù and "string ReadResponse()".
 // First open the serial port (baud rate, etc.) configured at design or run time.
 // It is good practice to use try-catch blocks for exception handling.
 serialPort1.Open();
 if (serialPort1.IsOpen) // serialPort1 is the name of the serial port component
 {
 try // In case there is a read timeout or other exception occurs
 {
 // Write the command (refer to GCL2 commands in the instrument's User Guide)
 // followed by a carriage return character (0xD)
 serialPort1.Write("?\r");
 // Read the response. ReadLine() will wait (for a timeout) until the termination
 // character (LF (or "new line") = "\n" = 0xA by default) is received.
 string response = serialPort1.ReadLine().Trim();
 // Typical response from a Mark-10 gauge: "3.258 lbF\r\n" so need to parse
 // the string to get the floating-point numeric value and the unit.
 
 // For example: 
 // Can parse a string on a space as follows:
 // string[] str = response.Split(' '); // str[0] is the load, str[1] is the unit
 
 // Convert the numeric ASCII part of the string to a float or double:
 //double d_number, load;
 //if (double.TryParse(str[0], out d_number))
 // load = d_number;
 //else
 // // Do whatever error handling desired.
 }
 catch (Exception ex) // Could look for a TimeoutException explictly
 {
 Debug.Print("Serial Port Exception: " + ex.Message); // For example
 }
 }
 else
 {
 // Do whatever, such as inform the user that the serial port is not open.
